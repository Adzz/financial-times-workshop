  Pretty cool right?

  So what did you notice?

  You should have noticed a few things.

  First of all the file opened in our web browser. This was because we saved it as `.html`; the computer
  knew we had a webpage, and that the web browser (chrome, firefox or internet explorer) was the most
  appropriate place to open that file.

  Next, the text that was written between the two funny things that said `<h1>` appeared on the page.

  Thirdly, that ONLY the text between there showed on the page. None of the instructions did.

  Why is that?

  HTML works like this, there are tags, each tag does a specific thing. Usually you write something
  in between the tags and the stuff inside the tag gets rendered as the thing the tag is telling you
  it is.

  Most HTML tags have an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag looks like this:

  <h1>

  The closing tag looks like this:

  </h1>

  Notice the slash?

  Try changing the text inside the tag on the index.html page, then save it then refresh your browser
  or re-open the file in the web browser. What happens?

  Below we have added a new tag, with some text in it - an H2 tag.

  Try opening this file inside your browser, how do the H1 and H2 tag differ?
  What do you think the H stands for? Discuss with your pair!
  What happens if you try H3... in fact I wonder how many H tags there are....?

  When you've had a play, move on to part_three.html
