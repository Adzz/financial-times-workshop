  Below is what our webpage in part_five should look like about now. If yours is different, don't worry.
  Take a second to compare yours and see where it differs.

  Anytime you make a new html page from now on, remember to first add an HTML tag, then inside it a
  <head> tag and a <body> tag. All the stuff we normally write - the stuff that we want to see on the
  page should go inside the body tags.

  Now let's try something new... Pictures!

  All our HTML tags so far have had an opening tag and a closing tag. The `img` tag is the exception
  that proves the rule. The img tag is known as a self closing tag, it looks like this:

  <img src="">

  notice how we DONT do this: <img></img>, that's what we mean by self closing.

  But what is that src="" bit?? The src is an example of an attribute. Attributes live inside the opening
  tag in HTML. They add extra things to the HTML, and we will look at more examples as we go ahead.

  For img tags, the src attribute is how we tell the computer what image you want to appear on the page

  We can go to somewhere like https://unsplash.com/ and find photos that are free to use in our website.
  Once you have found a photo, right click on it and choose the option that says "copy image address",
  you can then paste that inside the speech marks in the src attribute, like this:

  <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1529257414772-1960b7bea4eb?ixlib=rb-0.3.5&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&s=99a036a823f65958ab245848f5091dd7&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1950&q=80">

  The address may be long, but don't worry. Try adding an image into the HTML below

  <h1>Financial Times Workshop - best thing since sliced bread!</h1>
  <h2>Attendees learn HTML webpages - How To Make Lucrative webpages.</h2>
  <p>
    Attendees at a Financial Times workshop, ran in partnership with Makers Academy, were blown away by today by how quickly they managed to progress. Coaches led the would be students in a series of practical exercises requiring skills in front end programming, and expressed surprise at how quickly everyone picked them up. Participants identified three things as essential to becoming a programmer:
    <ul>
      <li>Knowledge of HTML</li>
      <li>Perseverance</li>
      <li>Snacks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In order of importance:"</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Snacks</li>
      <li>Perseverance</li>
      <li>Knowledge of HTML</li>
    </ol>
