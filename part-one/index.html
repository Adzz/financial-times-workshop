  Every kind of programming, boils down to one thing:

  Writing out instructions for the computer to execute.

  That's all.

  You do this by writing text to a file (as clumsy as that sounds - and it can be!). The text you write
  can then be given to the computer and executed. In this process the computer parses the text you
  have written, figures out what instructions you've asked it to do, then does them.

  There are a whole host of languages that can be used to achieve this. Some are more appropriate
  than others for a given task, it all depends on what precisely you are trying to do. You write
  your programs in that language, and you write them in a file with a specific file extension that
  tells the computer what language you have written the instructions in.

  File extensions are exactly like the ones you may know already. When you have a picture saved onto
  the computer that is called `cat.jpeg`. the `.jpeg` part tells the computer, "this is a picture, so
  treat it accordingly".

  We are here today to learn about a specific type of programming - web development. Web development
  is the process of making websites. There are broadly two parts to a website, the stuff you can see
  and all the stuff behind it that helps to make it work. The two parts are known as the Front End and
  the Back End respectively.

  Here's an example. When you go to the Financial Times and log in, the front end would be the thing
  that shows you two inputs on the page - a password field and an email field. The back end would be
  the part that after you have clicked 'log in' takes your input and either finds all the information
  related to your account, or tells you that your information was incorrect.

  Today we will focus on the Front End.

  The front end can be said to consist of three languages. Can you name them?

  To begin with we will look at a language called HTML. It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language,
  (although that is not important). Every single webpage on the internet contains HTML.

  We tell the computer that the file we are using is html by saving the file with a'.html' at the end.

  We have already done that with this file. I have also put some HTML below. Find this file in your
  file explorer (finder on a mac, or file explorer in windows) and double click it to see what happens,
  then open part_two.html in your text editor to continue.
