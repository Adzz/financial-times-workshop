<!--
  Now that we know about nesting and indentation, we can start including some tags that we have left
  out thus far for simplicity.

  All HTMl pages should be written with a number of basic tags. First you need an <html> tag, which
  simply says that everything inside here is HTML. Then inside the html tag, you need a <head> tag and
  a <body> tag.

  The head tag is a special place on the page where we can put things that won't directly appear on
  the webpage. We will come back to this later. For now try adding a <title> tag inside of it
  and see if you can spot what changes when you add text inside the title tag.

  After that, copy and paste the html code from part_four.html to INSIDE the body tag. Remember to
  fix indentation!

  No hints this time, you can do it!
