## Financial Times Workshop

Hello lovely people, and welcome! The files found here are designed to help ignite a passion that you didn't know you had.

With these files we will explore some of the fundamentals of front end web development, have a go at writing some web pages of our own and hope to both answer and beget the very thing that brought you here in the first place: Questions!

What is front end web development?

What even are web pages?

How the hell do you make them?

The purpose of this session is not to teach you programming, but to teach you how to learn programming.

### How to Begin

1. Ensure you have a text editor on your machine (note Microsoft word is not a text editor!), I would recommend [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), it has an unlimited free trial!

2. Download these files. Open the download files in your text editor, then begin inside the part-one folder. Inside there is a list of files. Start with `index.html`, then work through them in number order!

Remember there is no such thing as cheating! Google-ing for answers is heavily encouraged - knowing how to ask the right questions is a vital skill for programmers.
