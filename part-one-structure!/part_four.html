  There are two kinds of lists you can have in HTML. An Ordered List and an Unordered List

  The ordered lists will number the list items, the unordered list will put a bullet point next to
  the list items.

  Below is an example using <ul> = unordered list, <ol> = ordered list, <li> = list item.

  Below we see a really important convention emerging: indentation.
  When we nest a tag inside of another tag, we open the initial tag, then go onto the next line,
  then indent by two or four spaces. Then we start the nested tag, like this:

  <ol>
    <li>Snacks</li>
    <li>Perseverance</li>
    <li>Knowledge of HTML</li>
  </ol>

  This is a super important convention when programming, because as we make more and more complex webpages
  we will have more nesting happening. This convention of indenting makes it much much easier to see
  what is happening, and crucially for others to understand what is happening quicker as well. Compare:

  <ol><li>Perseverance</li><li>Snacks</li><li>Knowledge of HTML</li></ol>

  Yuck!

  Another great tip when writing html is to open AND close the tag you are about to use immediately,
  then go back and fill in what you want to put inside it. That way you will never have an opening
  tag without a closing tag - which can lead to very big problems! So when I wrote the list below,
  I wrote <ol></ol>, then went back and added the indentation, and the inner <li> tags.

  You may have noticed when you played with the p tag, that the new lines didn't appear on the webpage
  when we typed them in the p tag. This is because the computer strips out whitespace, so that we can
  use indentation to make our code easier to read.

  So what do you think we can do if we want the next sentence to actually  be on a new line? Add a new
  p tag!
  Try that below, then move on to part_five.html

<h1>Financial Times Workshop - best thing since sliced bread!</h1>
<h2>Attendees learn HTML webpages - How To Make Lucrative webpages.</h2>
<p>
  Attendees at a Financial Times workshop, ran in partnership with Makers Academy, were blown away by today by how quickly they managed to progress. Coaches led the would be students in a series of practical exercises requiring skills in front end programming, and expressed surprise at how quickly everyone picked them up. Participants identified three things as essential to becoming a programmer:
  <ul>
    <li>Knowledge of HTML</li>
    <li>Perseverance</li>
    <li>Snacks</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In order of importance</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Snacks</li>
    <li>Perseverance</li>
    <li>Knowledge of HTML</li>
  </ol>
</p>
