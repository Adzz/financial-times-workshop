  It turns our the H stands for Heading. The numbers denote the size of the heading - H1 being
  the largest, on down to H6. If you tried an H7 tag, it probably worked - but it didn't look any
  different from the H6. That's because the browsers nowadays are especially clever, and it has tried
  to help you by rendering what it thought you meant - an H6!

  So why are these instructions not showing up on the webpage? It turns out they are wrapped in a special

  Remember this for later.

  Here's a new fact: HTML tags can contain other HTML tags nested inside of them.

  We want to add to the bottom of the page a bullet point list of skills learnt. Your challenge is to
  find the most appropriate HTML tag you may need to do this - Hint - you will need to find two
  tags, and nest one inside the other.

  Remember there is no such thing as cheating, googling is required!
