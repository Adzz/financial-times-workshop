    <h1>Financial Times Workshop - best thing since sliced bread!</h1>
    <h2>Attendees learn HTML webpages - How To Make Lucrative webpages.</h2>
    <p>
      Attendees at a Financial Times workshop, ran in partnership with <a href="https://makers.tech/">Makers</a>, were blown away by today by how quickly they managed to progress. Coaches led the would be students in a series of practical exercises requiring skills in front end programming, and expressed surprise at how quickly everyone picked them up. Participants identified three things as essential to becoming a programmer:
      <ul>
        <li>Knowledge of HTML</li>
        <li>Perseverance</li>
        <li>Snacks</li>
      </ul>
      In order of importance:
      <ol>
        <li>Snacks</li>
        <li>Perseverance</li>
        <li>Knowledge of HTML</li>
      </ol>
