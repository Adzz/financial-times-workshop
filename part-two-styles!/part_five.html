<!--
  When we add a class in the HTML, we add an attribute inside the opening tag like this:
  <li class="first-item">

  Then in the CSS, we target that class by putting a full stop before the name of the class:

  .first-item { ... }

  This says, find me all of the bits on the page that have a class of "first-item" and apply the styles
  inside the curly brackets to them.

  Classes are great because we can write one class that is re-used in lots of places AND we can have
  one element which has multiple classes on them.

  Below I have re-used the styles applied in the first list to the second list, by simply adding classes
  to more elements. This is excellent as it helps obey a common principle in programming DRY - Don't
  Repeat Yourself.

  We can also re-use styles by applying multiple classes to one element. We do this by putting a space
  between the class names:

  <li class="name-of-first-class name-of-second-class">

  See if you can use this knowledge to change the code below so that we only write:

  font-family: "Helvetica";

  Once in the CSS. The webpage should look exactly the same in the browser when you open it. Only the
  code should look slightly different.

<html>
  <head>
    <title>Financial Times Workshop</title>
    <style type="text/css">
      h1 {
        color: red;
        font-family: "Helvetica";
      }

      h2 {
        color: green;
        font-family: "Helvetica";
      }

      .first-item {
        color: hotpink;
      }

      .second-item {
        color: red;
      }
    </style>

    <h1>Financial Times Workshop - best thing since sliced bread!</h1>
    <h2>Attendees learn HTML webpages - How To Make Lucrative webpages.</h2>
    <p>
      Attendees at a Financial Times workshop, ran in partnership with <a href="https://makers.tech/">Makers Academy</a>, were blown away by today by how quickly they managed to progress. Coaches led the would be students in a series of practical exercises requiring skills in front end programming, and expressed surprise at how quickly everyone picked them up. Participants identified three things as essential to becoming a programmer:
      <ul>
        <li class="first-item">Knowledge of HTML</li>
        <li class="second-item">Perseverance</li>
        <li>Snacks</li>
      </ul>
      In order of importance:"
      <ol>
        <li class="first-item">Snacks</li>
        <li class="second-item">Perseverance</li>
        <li>Knowledge of HTML</li>
      </ol>
