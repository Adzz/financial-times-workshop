<!--
  Hopefully you noticed the text in the H1 changed colour. Unfortunately you may also have noticed a
  grave error by the inventor of CSS... Colour is spelt wrong!

  In Css colour is color and centre is center. Yuck.

  That aside, let's break down the syntax.

  h1 {
    color: red;
  }

  The H1 part we have seen before. That is the name of a tag in HTML. Then there are these curly
  brackets. Then it looks like we give properties that apply to the h1.

  Let's try adding another property. After the color: red, still within the curly brackets, put this

  font-family: "Helvetica";

  Then load this page and see what happens. What did you expect would happen?

  Now the real challenge, see if you can change the color of the h2 tag. Hint, you can put what you
  need inside of the same style tag as before, but after the h1 styles.

  Have a go below, then move to part_three.html
 -->

<html>
  <head>
    <title>Financial Times Workshop</title>
    <style type="text/css">
      h1 {
        color: red;
      }
      /* New styles here */
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Financial Times Workshop - best thing since sliced bread!</h1>
    <h2>Attendees learn HTML webpages - How To Make Lucrative webpages.</h2>
    <p>
      Attendees at a Financial Times workshop, ran in partnership with <a href="https://makers.tech/">Makers Academy</a>, were blown away by today by how quickly they managed to progress. Coaches led the would be students in a series of practical exercises requiring skills in front end programming, and expressed surprise at how quickly everyone picked them up. Participants identified three things as essential to becoming a programmer:
      <ul>
        <li>Knowledge of HTML</li>
        <li>Perseverance</li>
        <li>Snacks</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In order of importance:"</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Snacks</li>
        <li>Perseverance</li>
        <li>Knowledge of HTML</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
