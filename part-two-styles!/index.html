<!--
  You're doing awesome! Hopefully by now however you have noticed something about our website - it
  looks awful. What we need is some style

  To get styles on a page we need to introduce a new language on the front end. This one is called
  CSS. It stands for Cascading Style Sheets, though again that isn't important.

  CSS will allow us to change fonts, size, position and colour of anything on the page.

  But it has a new syntax. It looks like this:

    h1 {
      color: red;
    }

Try first of all copying the CSS above and pasting it in between the style tags below, then open this
HTML page in your browser. What do you expect to happen? What actually does?

    <h1>Financial Times Workshop - best thing since sliced bread!</h1>
    <h2>Attendees learn HTML webpages - How To Make Lucrative webpages.</h2>
    <p>
      Attendees at a Financial Times workshop, ran in partnership with <a href="https://makers.tech/">Makers Academy</a>, were blown away by today by how quickly they managed to progress. Coaches led the would be students in a series of practical exercises requiring skills in front end programming, and expressed surprise at how quickly everyone picked them up. Participants identified three things as essential to becoming a programmer:
      <ul>
        <li>Knowledge of HTML</li>
        <li>Perseverance</li>
        <li>Snacks</li>
      </ul>
      In order of importance:"
      <ol>
        <li>Snacks</li>
        <li>Perseverance</li>
        <li>Knowledge of HTML</li>
      </ol>
