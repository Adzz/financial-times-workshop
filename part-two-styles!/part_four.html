<!--
  Hopefully, what you will have noticed is that all of the <li>s on the page turned pink.

  In order to turn just one of them pink, we need a way to hook into just that one element.
  We do this by using a class. A class is like a hook into the HTML, that we can put on one or many
  elements.

  There are two parts to using a class, adding it to the HTML, and adding it to the CSS. Have a look
  below and see if you can spot where we have used a class in the HTML and CSS.

  Have a go at adding your own class - try making the second element in the list red.

    <h2>Attendees learn HTML webpages - How To Make Lucrative webpages.</h2>
    <p>
      Attendees at a Financial Times workshop, ran in partnership with <a href="https://makers.tech/">Makers Academy</a>, were blown away by today by how quickly they managed to progress. Coaches led the would be students in a series of practical exercises requiring skills in front end programming, and expressed surprise at how quickly everyone picked them up. Participants identified three things as essential to becoming a programmer:
      <ul>
        <li class="first-item">Knowledge of HTML</li>
        <li>Perseverance</li>
        <li>Snacks</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In order of importance:"</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Snacks</li>
        <li>Perseverance</li>
        <li>Knowledge of HTML</li>
      </ol>
