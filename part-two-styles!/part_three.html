  Below is an example of what you may have tried. Compare it to your answer and see how you did!

  What we have done so far is targeted something on the HTML page in our CSS, then selected some styles
  that should apply to the thing we targeted.

  So far we have said "Find me all the h1's on the page, then make them red, and make their font helvetica"
  Then we said "Find me all of the H2's on the page and make them green and their font helvetica"

  This is great, but what if we want to make just on of the list items in the list below stand out.
  How would we target just one list item?

  Start by trying adding this to the styles below:

  li {
    color: hotpink;
  }

  What happens?

<html>
  <head>
    <title>Financial Times Workshop</title>
    <style type="text/css">
      h1 {
        color: red;
        font-family: "Helvetica";
      }

      h2 {
        color: green;
        font-family: "Helvetica";
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Financial Times Workshop - best thing since sliced bread!</h1>
    <h2>Attendees learn HTML webpages - How To Make Lucrative webpages.</h2>
    <p>
      Attendees at a Financial Times workshop, ran in partnership with <a href="https://makers.tech/">Makers</a>, were blown away by today by how quickly they managed to progress. Coaches led the would be students in a series of practical exercises requiring skills in front end programming, and expressed surprise at how quickly everyone picked them up. Participants identified three things as essential to becoming a programmer:
      <ul>
        <li>Knowledge of HTML</li>
        <li>Perseverance</li>
        <li>Snacks</li>
      </ul>
      In order of importance:
      <ol>
        <li>Snacks</li>
        <li>Perseverance</li>
        <li>Knowledge of HTML</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
