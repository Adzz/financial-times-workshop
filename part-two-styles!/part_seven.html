<!--
  This now looks much nicer! And we have one place where the styles live, another where the markup
  lives.

  This also allows us to explore another concept in programming. Open Source!

  Similar to how we could add a photo from the internet by putting in a web address in the <img> href
  We can also add other people's code using the power of the internet!

  In part three we are going to look at how we can use other people's code to help speed our development

    <p>
      Attendees at a Financial Times workshop, ran in partnership with <a href="https://makers.tech/">Makers Academy</a>, were blown away by today by how quickly they managed to progress. Coaches led the would be students in a series of practical exercises requiring skills in front end programming, and expressed surprise at how quickly everyone picked them up. Participants identified three things as essential to becoming a programmer:
      <ul>
        <li class="first-item">Knowledge of HTML</li>
        <li class="second-item">Perseverance</li>
        <li>Snacks</li>
      </ul>
      In order of importance:"
      <ol>
        <li class="first-item">Snacks</li>
        <li class="second-item">Perseverance</li>
        <li>Knowledge of HTML</li>
      </ol>
