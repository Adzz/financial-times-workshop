<!--
  This now looks much nicer! And we have one place where the styles live, another where the markup
  lives.

  Now we can continue to add to the styles, without our markup becoming to hard to read.

  Have you noticed the picture and how it's much too large to be of any use to anyone? Well we can
  change that!

  In CSS there are two properties that will help us, helpfully called `height` and `width`. Usually
  this is done in pixels:

  height: 20px;
  width: 20px;

  Have a go at adding a height and width to the img below using CSS. Add any CSS into the file named
  styles2.css You may need to play around with different values to find something that looks good!

<html>
  <head>
    <title>Financial Times Workshop</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles2.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1 class="nice-font">Financial Times Workshop - best thing since sliced bread!</h1>
    <h2 class="nice-font">Attendees learn HTML webpages - How To Make Lucrative webpages.</h2>
    <p>
      Attendees at a Financial Times workshop, ran in partnership with <a href="https://makers.tech/">Makers</a>, were blown away by today by how quickly they managed to progress. Coaches led the would be students in a series of practical exercises requiring skills in front end programming, and expressed surprise at how quickly everyone picked them up. Participants identified three things as essential to becoming a programmer:
      <ul>
        <li class="first-item">Knowledge of HTML</li>
        <li class="second-item">Perseverance</li>
        <li>Snacks</li>
      </ul>
      In order of importance:
      <ol>
        <li class="first-item">Snacks</li>
        <li class="second-item">Perseverance</li>
        <li>Knowledge of HTML</li>
      </ol>
