  Nice work, that process you just did is known as Refactoring. It's a way to improve the readability
  of the code, without changing what the code actually does.

  Find out more later here: https://tech.nested.com/tech-for-the-non-technical-refactoring-2f80106db689

  Now there is one more thing we can do to refactor the code. It's getting a bit messy having the css
  and the HTML in the same file. The more we write the bigger this file will get. Instead we are going
  to pull out the CSS into a separate file, and include it into the HTML. To do this we will use a new
  tag in the <head> of the page, called link. It looks like this:

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="">

  Remember that href from before? We used it for a hyperlink to tell the browser where we wanted to
  link to. The principle is the same here. We are going to add a link in our head, and the href will
  be the path to where our CSS file is. We can ignore the other attributes for now.

  Copy and paste the CSS that's INSIDE the style tags into the file called styles.css in this folder, then
  delete the style tags (and everything in them). Then in the <link> tag put the name of the CSS file
  as the href attribute. You should be able to open this page after and it should look exactly the
  same.

    <style type="text/css">
      .nice-font {

      h1 {
        color: red;

      .first-item {
        color: hotpink;

    <h2 class="nice-font">Attendees learn HTML webpages - How To Make Lucrative webpages.</h2>
    <p>
      Attendees at a Financial Times workshop, ran in partnership with <a href="https://makers.tech/">Makers</a>, were blown away by today by how quickly they managed to progress. Coaches led the would be students in a series of practical exercises requiring skills in front end programming, and expressed surprise at how quickly everyone picked them up. Participants identified three things as essential to becoming a programmer:
      <ul>
        <li class="first-item">Knowledge of HTML</li>
        <li class="second-item">Perseverance</li>
        <li>Snacks</li>
      </ul>
      In order of importance:
      <ol>
        <li class="first-item">Snacks</li>
        <li class="second-item">Perseverance</li>
        <li>Knowledge of HTML</li>
      </ol>
