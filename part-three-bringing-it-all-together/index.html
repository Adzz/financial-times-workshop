<!--
  We have looked at enough tools by now that we can start to understand even a file as big and scary
  this one.

  Take a look at the first <link> tag. Notice how the href points to somehwere on the internet, rather than
  somehwere on our local computer?

  Similar to how we could add a photo from the internet by putting in a web address in the <img> href,
  we can also add other people's code using the power of the internet!

  That link links to a giant CSS file written by the developers of the Financial Times. You can make
  use of the code they have written by putting classes on our HTML elements.

  Take a look through this file. Open it in the browser and see if you can break it down into parts
  you can understand.

  Try adding and removing parts to see what changes.

      <p>
        Attendees at a Financial Times workshop, ran in partnership with <a href="https://makers.tech/">Makers</a>, were blown away by today by how quickly they managed to progress. Coaches led the would be students in a series of practical exercises requiring skills in front end programming, and expressed surprise at how quickly everyone picked them up. Participants identified three things as essential to becoming a programmer:
        <ul>
          <li class="first-item">Knowledge of HTML</li>
          <li class="second-item">Perseverance</li>
          <li>Snacks</li>
        </ul>
        In order of importance:
        <ol>
          <li class="first-item">Snacks</li>
          <li class="second-item">Perseverance</li>
          <li>Knowledge of HTML</li>
